## Project Objective: 
The objective of this Power BI project is to analyze and visualize Superstore sales data to uncover business insights and support data-driven decision-making. The dashboard focuses on:
- YoY comparison of Sales and Profit to track performance trends.
- Sales analysis by Region, Segment, Payment Mode, Ship Mode, and Sub-Category.
- 15-day sales forecasting using time series analysis for better planning and demand prediction.

## Key Insights:
- Region-wise Sales: The West region leads with the highest sales (522.44K), followed by East and Central, while the South lags behind.
- Segment-wise Sales: The Consumer segment contributes the most to overall sales (753K), significantly ahead of Corporate and Home Office.
- Payment Mode: Cash on Delivery (COD) is the most used payment mode (667.42K), followed by Online and Cards.
- Ship Mode: Standard Class dominates shipping methods (0.91M), while First Class is least preferred.
- Geographical Trends: States on the East and West Coasts show higher sales and profit concentrations.
- Category & Sub-category: Office Supplies leads in category sales; within sub-categories, Phones generate the highest revenue, while Fasteners contribute the least.

## Project Learnings:
- Gained hands-on experience in creating an interactive Power BI dashboard with slicers, maps, and custom visuals.
- Learned to apply time series analysis for short-term sales forecasting.
- Understood the impact of dimensional analysis (region, segment, etc.) in uncovering business patterns.

## Recommendations:
